# Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
#
#  A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
#
#
#  Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
#  Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
#  Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes
#  of the grid.
#
#
#  The '.' character indicates empty cells.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5"
# ,".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".","."
# ,".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".","."
# ,"6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"
# ],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4
# ","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3
# "],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],[
# "9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3",
# "4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
# Explanation:¬†The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is sho
# wn below:
#
#
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  board.length == 9
#  board[i].length == 9
#  board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
#  It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.
